        <p>Our data is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nycparks/tree-census/data">kaggle.com</a>. The  website has tree census data collected by the Department of Parks and Recreation for 1995, 2005 and 2015. We used data from 2015. However, due to the sheer size of the survey, and our hardware limitations, we weren't able to include all of it. We only included the first 1000 trees.</p>
